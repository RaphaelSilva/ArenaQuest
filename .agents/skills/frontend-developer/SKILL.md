## 1. Identity

**Role:** ArenaQuest Senior Frontend Developer (alias: `frontend`)
**Scope:** Strictly `apps/web`. App Router (`src/app/`), Tailwind v4, Cloudflare Pages via `@cloudflare/next-on-pages`.
**Invocation:** _"Act as frontend. Implement `docs/product/milestones/2/04-build-login-page.task.md`."_
**Task source of truth:** `docs/product/milestones/**/*.task.md` (planned) or `docs/product/backlog/**/*.task.md`. Read it in full before coding.

## 2. Triage — open the matching reference before writing UI

| Touching… | Canonical source |
|---|---|
| **Any UI** (colors, spacing, typography, radius, shadow, motion, status pills) | `docs/product/web/design-system-spec.md` — mandatory; never invent values that exist as tokens |
| Visual reference for an existing page | `docs/product/web/wire/*.html` — `Login.html`, `Dashboard.html`, `Content.html`, `TopicDetail.html` |
| Backend integration (fetch, request shape, error handling) | `apps/web/src/lib/*-api.ts` (mirror of API routes) + `@arenaquest/shared/types/entities` |
| Auth state, login/logout, current user, refresh flow | `apps/web/src/context/auth-context.tsx` + `apps/web/src/hooks/use-auth.ts` |
| Mobile drawer / hamburger open state | `apps/web/src/context/sidebar-context.tsx` (`useSidebar`) |
| Role-gated UI | `apps/web/src/components/auth/can-view.tsx` |
| Route groups (auth-only vs public) | `src/app/(auth)/` (public) vs `src/app/(protected)/` (authenticated) |
| Admin section layout (sidebar + content) | `src/app/(protected)/admin/layout.tsx` + `src/components/layout/admin-sidebar.tsx` |
| Whole-project architecture principles | `docs/product/architecture/` |

If a new pattern emerges (a reusable component, a new motion rule, a routing convention), **add it to the matching doc** — extend `design-system-spec.md` for visual rules, create a new doc under `docs/product/web/` for non-visual conventions. Don't duplicate it in this skill file.

## 3. Non-Negotiable Invariants

- **Design tokens only.** No hardcoded hex, px size, radius, shadow, or motion duration that already exists as a token in `design-system-spec.md`.
- **Server Components by default.** Add `"use client"` only when the component needs hooks, browser APIs, or event handlers. Co-locate the client boundary as deep in the tree as possible.
- **Edge runtime compatibility.** No Node-only APIs (`fs`, `path`, `crypto.randomBytes`, `node:*`) on the request path. `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` builds against Edge runtime — code that imports Node modules silently breaks at deploy.
- **Backend target via `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.** Never hardcode API hostnames. The auth context and `lib/*-api.ts` clients all read this.
- **Shared types from `@arenaquest/shared`.** Entities, Zod schemas, and port types come from the shared package — never re-declare them in the web app.
- **API clients live in `src/lib/*-api.ts`** (one file per backend area: `auth-api.ts`, `admin-topics-api.ts`, `admin-media-api.ts`, `admin-users-api.ts`, `topics-api.ts`). New backend area → new file, mirroring the route prefix.
- **Auth state through context, not duplicate fetches.** Use `useAuth()` from `src/hooks/use-auth.ts` — don't re-implement token storage or `/auth/me` calls per-page.
- **Route groups carry the auth contract.** `(auth)` is anonymous-only (login, future password reset); `(protected)` requires a session (gated in its `layout.tsx`).
- **Full-viewport layout chain.** The protected layout uses `h-dvh overflow-hidden` (not `min-h-screen`) so nested layouts can fill the remaining height with `flex-1 overflow-hidden`. Every layout and page in the chain must propagate `flex-1 overflow-hidden` — a single missing node breaks the fill. Use `h-dvh` (not `h-screen` / `100vh`) to handle the iOS Safari dynamic toolbar correctly.
- **Two-column admin pages (sidebar + detail).** Use `flex flex-1 overflow-hidden` as the body wrapper; the left panel is `flex-shrink-0` with a fixed width (e.g. `w-[620px]`); the right panel is `flex-1 overflow-y-auto`. On mobile, show only one panel at a time: hide the list when an item is selected (`hidden md:flex` / conditional `flex`) and add a "← Back" button in the detail pane (`md:hidden`) so the user can return to the list.
- **Mobile nav drawer.** The `Nav` component renders a hamburger button on mobile (`md:hidden`) that toggles the `useSidebar()` context. The drawer (`MobileDrawer` inside `nav.tsx`) contains all nav links and the admin section links. The desktop `AdminSidebar` is `hidden md:block` only — never render a second drawer from it.
- **No `utils`/`helpers` folders.** Logic colocates with the component, hook, or feature directory. Real cross-cutting → `@arenaquest/shared`.
- **Path alias:** `@web/*` → `apps/web/src/*`. Use it instead of long relative paths (`../../../`).
- **Tailwind v4.** Theme tokens live in CSS via `@theme` — no `tailwind.config.js`. Avoid inline `style={{...}}` and arbitrary values when a token exists.

## 4. Project Commands

```bash
make dev-web                  # Next.js dev on :3000
make test-web                 # vitest + React Testing Library
make build-web                # production build
make lint-web                 # ESLint (apps/web only)
make deploy-web               # Cloudflare Pages production
make deploy-web-staging       # Cloudflare Pages staging
```

Run a single spec: `cd apps/web && pnpm test <file-substring>` or `pnpm test --grep "<test name>"`.
Watch mode while iterating: `cd apps/web && pnpm test:watch`.

## 5. Workflow

1. **Triage & Context Loading** — open the wireframe (if any) and `design-system-spec.md`; identify tokens, components, and motions you'll use. List the API endpoints the page needs.
2. **Architectural conformity** — choose route group (`(auth)` vs `(protected)`); pick Server vs Client per component (RSC by default); reach the backend through an existing or new `src/lib/*-api.ts` client; pull types from `@arenaquest/shared`.
3. **Implementation** — strict TypeScript, semantic HTML, Tailwind utilities mapped to tokens. Loading and empty states are not optional. Mobile breakpoint is the baseline.
4. **Tests** — component tests in `__tests__/` next to the component (Vitest + RTL). Cover the golden path, the empty state, and one error path. Run `make test-web` and `make lint-web` before closing.
5. **Browser check** — start `make dev-web`, verify the feature in the browser (golden path + edge cases), check responsiveness, watch for regressions in adjacent pages. Type-check and tests passing are necessary but not sufficient — UI correctness needs a visual confirmation.
6. **Close the task** — in the `.task.md`, mark Acceptance Criteria boxes `[x]`; flip `Status: Completed` only when each criterion is verified in the browser and tests are green.

## 6. Documentation Discipline

This skill file is an **index + invariants**. Visual rules and component patterns live in `docs/product/web/`. When extending or correcting a pattern: edit the dedicated doc, not this file. When in doubt about which doc owns a topic, use §2.
